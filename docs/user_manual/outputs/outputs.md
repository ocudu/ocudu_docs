## Logs

srsRAN Project provides users with a highly configurable logging mechanism, with per-layer and per-component log levels. Set the log file path and log levels in the gNB config
file. See the [Configuration Reference](config_ref.md#manual-config-ref) for more details.

The format used for all log messages is as follows:

> *Timestamp [Layer] [Level] [TTI] message*

Where the fields are:

> * Timestamp in *YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.UUUUUU* format at which log message was generated
> * Layer can be one of *MAC/RLC/PDCP/RRC/SDAP/NGAP/GTPU/RADIO/FAPI/F1U/DU/CU/LIB*. PHY layers are specified as downlink or uplink and with executor number e.g. *DL-PHY1*.
> * Level can be one of *E/W/I/D* for error, warning, info and debug respectively.
> * TTI is only shown for PHY or MAC messages and is in the format *SFN.sn* where SFN is System Frame Number and sn is slot number.

An example log file excerpt can be seen below:

## PCAPs

srsRAN Project can output PCAPs at the following layers:

> - MAC
> - RLC
> - NGAP
> - N3
> - E1AP
> - F1AP
> - E2AP

To output these PCAPs, they must first be enabled on a per-layer basis in the gNB configuration file. See the [Configuration Reference](config_ref.md#manual-config-ref) for more details.

### MAC

To analyze a MAC-layer PCAP using Wireshark, you will need to configure User DLT 149 for UDP and enable the mac_nr_udp protocol:

> 1. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=149 and Payload protocol=udp.
> 2. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=157 and Payload protocol=mac-nr-framed.
> 3. Go to Analyze->Enabled Protocols->MAC-NR and enable mac_nr_udp
> 4. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->MAC-NR: Enable both checkboxes “Attempt to…”; Set LCID->DRB mapping to “From configuration protocol”.
![image](user_manuals/source/.imgs/mac_pcap.png)

### RLC

#### NOTE
To correctly view the RLC PCAPs you will need Wireshark v4.3.x or later.

To analyze a RLC-layer PCAP using Wireshark, you will need to configure User DLT 149 for UDP and enable the rlc_nr_udp protocol:

> 1. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=149 and Payload protocol=udp.
> 2. Go to Analyze->Enabled Protocols->RLC-NR and enable rlc_nr_udp
> 3. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->RLC-NR and configure according to your needs.
![image](user_manuals/source/.imgs/rlc_pcap.png)

### NGAP

To analyze an NGAP-layer PCAP using Wireshark, you will need to configure User DLT 152 for NGAP and enable detection and decoding 5G-EA0 ciphered messages:

> 1. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=152 and Payload protocol=ngap.
> 2. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->NAS-5GS and enable “Try to detect and decode 5G-EA0 ciphered messages”.
![image](user_manuals/source/.imgs/ngap_pcap.png)

### N3

To analyze a N3 PCAP using Wireshark, you will need to configure User DLT 156 for GTP:

> 1. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=156 and Payload Protocol=gtp.
![image](user_manuals/source/.imgs/gtpu_pcap.png)

### E1AP

To analyze an E1AP PCAP using Wireshark, you will need to configure User DLT 153 for E1AP:

> 1. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=153 and Payload Protocol=e1ap.
![image](user_manuals/source/.imgs/e1ap_pcap.png)

### F1AP

To analyze an F1AP PCAP using Wireshark, you will need to configure User DLT 154 for F1AP:

> 1. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=154 and Payload Protocol=f1ap.
![image](user_manuals/source/.imgs/f1ap_pcap.png)

<a id="e2ap-pcap"></a>

### E2AP

To analyze an E2AP PCAP using Wireshark, you will need to configure User DLT 155 for E2AP:

> 1. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=155 and Payload Protocol=e2ap.

## JSON Metrics

srsRAN Project supports the reporting of the console metrics to JSON data format over websocket. This is used to generate the output seen in the [GrafanaGUI](grafana_gui.md#grafana-gui).

The metrics can be received and printed to `stdout` using a Python script.

Firstly, the metrics output and remote control can be enabled by adding the following to your configuration file:

```yaml
metrics:
  enable_json: true
remote_control:
  bind_addr: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8001
  enabled: true
```

With this enabled, the websocket will listen on `127.0.0.1:8001`. The metrics can be subscribed and written to `stdout` in real-time while the gNB is running using the following Python code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from contextlib import suppress
import os
import json
from time import sleep
import websocket

def _on_open(ws: websocket.WebSocketApp):
    ws.send(json.dumps({"cmd": "metrics_subscribe"}))

def _on_message(_ws: websocket.WebSocketApp, message: str):
    with suppress(json.JSONDecodeError):
        metric = json.loads(message)
        if "cmd" not in metric:
            print(json.dumps(metric))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ws_app = websocket.WebSocketApp(
        "ws://" + os.environ["WS_URL"],
        on_open=_on_open,
        on_message=_on_message,
    )
    while ws_app.run_forever():  # Returns False when the connection is closed
        sleep(1)
```

You must specify the address and port of the websocket via environment variable `WS_URL`, e.g. start the script as follows:

```bash
WS_URL="127.0.0.1:8001" ./metrics_ws_receiver.py
```

This script will need to be run in parallel with the gNB to successfully print the metrics. The metrics will be written to `stdout`.

You can download the source-code for the above Python script [`here`](.scripts/metrics_ws_receiver.py).

The metrics are generated on a layer basis, and each layer can be enabled through the configuration file.

```yaml
metrics:
  layers:                    # Enable metrics per layer
    enable_executor: true    # false to disable
    enable_app_usage: true   # false to disable
    enable_ngap: true        # false to disable
    enable_rrc: true         # false to disable
    enable_e1ap: true        # false to disable
    enable_pdcp: true        # false to disable
    enable_sched: true       # false to disable
    enable_rlc: true         # false to disable
    enable_mac: true         # false to disable
    enable_du_low: true      # false to disable
    enable_ru: true          # false to disable
```

<a id="mac-metrics"></a>

### MAC metrics

The MAC metrics are encapsulated in the DU metric object, which contains the following keys:

> - `du`: Includes the DU high metrics under the `du_high` key, which contains the `mac` metrics, which in turn contains `dl` metrics, which is a list of cells with specific MAC dowlink metrics. Each entry in the `dl` list corresponds to a cell configured in the DU.
> - `timestamp`: Date and time at which the metrics were generated.

and is structured as shown below.

```default
{
  "du": {
    "du_high": {
      "mac": {
        "dl": [   # List of cells, one item with MAC metrics per cell.
          {
            "average_latency_us": 45.473, "cpu_usage_percent": 0.0045473, "max_latency_us": 255.174, "min_latency_us": 6.918, "pci": 1
          },
          {
            "average_latency_us": 44.533, "cpu_usage_percent": 0.0044533, "max_latency_us": 232.088, "min_latency_us": 5.822, "pci": 2
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-11-04T15:51:26.845"
}
```

The table below describes the MAC metrics reported in the DU metrics JSON output, under the `dl` key.

| **MAC metrics**                    | **Description**                                                                   |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pci`                              | Physical cell ID.                                                                 |
| `average_latency_us`               | Average latency of the MAC at handling slot indications, in microseconds.         |
| `cpu_usage_percent`                | Average CPU usage percentage of the MAC handling slot indications.                |
| `min_latency_us`, `max_latency_us` | Minimum/Maximum latency of the MAC at handling slot indications, in microseconds. |

<a id="scheduler-metrics"></a>

### Scheduler metrics

The scheduler metrics object contains 2 keys:

> - `cells`: List of cell metrics objects, one per cell configured in the DU; this list is accessed through the key `cells`, which is structured similarly as shown below:
> - `timestamp`: Date and time at which the metrics were generated.
```default
{
  "cells": [   # List of cells, one metric object per cell.
    {
      "cell_metrics": {
        "average_latency": 3,
        ...
      },
      "event_list": [   # List of events for this cell.
        {
          "event_type": "ue_create",
          "rnti": 17921,
          "slot": "50.5"
        },
        ...
      ],
      "ue_list": [   # List of UEs for this cell with their metrics.
        {
          "avg_ce_delay": 3.75,
          ...
        }
      ]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "timestamp": "2025-11-04T02:12:48.105"
}
```

Each element of the `cells` list contains the metrics of the cell, which can be accessed through the following keys:

> - `cell_metrics`: reports the cell metrics for a given cell; refer to [Scheduler cell metrics](#scheduler-cell-metrics) for details.
> - `event_list`: list of events reported in this cell metric report. Refer to [Cell events](#cell-events) for details.
> - `ue_list`: reports the list of UEs connected to this cell; each UE entry contains the UE metrics described in [Scheduler UE metrics](#scheduler-ue-metrics).
